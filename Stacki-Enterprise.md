[Stacki Enterprise](http://stackiq.com/compare-stacki-editions/) installs on top of existing Stacki deployments by adding the Boss Pallet along with the complete CentOS (or Red Hat) media.  Stacki Enterprise adds a monitoring and management portal allowing administrators to perform routine operations via a GUI rather than operating at the command line.  Stacki Enterprise also adds tight integration with SaltStack for a seamless handoff from the provisioning layer to the devops layer.

## Installation

Stack Enterprise can be installed on top of Stack v3.  Once you have a Stacki [Frontend](Frontend-Installation) built you will need do to the following:

### Boss Pallet

[Download] (http://www.stackiq.com/compare-stacki-editions/register-stacki-enterprise/) the Boss Pallet and copy the file to your Frontend.  Next add and enable the pallet like so:

        # stack list pallet
