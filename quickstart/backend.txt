Installing Backend Nodes
------------------------

This section covers how to install a |backend| node
using the StackIQ Web UI.


#.	After the Cluster Manager boots up, point your
	web-browser to the StackIQ Cluster Manager Web UI at
	``http://<cluster-manager-public-fqdn>/``. You should
	see the :ref:`figure-ui-screen`.

	.. _figure-ui-screen:
	.. figure:: ../images/ui/ui_screen_1.jpg

		StackIQ WebUI Start Screen

	Click on the Login link at
	the top right hand corner of the screen.

#.	The link opens a :ref:`figure-login-screen`.
	Use the username ``root`` and the password 
	that was chosen during installation on
	:ref:`figure-install-password-qsg`.

	.. _figure-login-screen:
	.. figure:: ../images/ui/ui_screen_login.jpg

		Login Dialog Box

#.	Click on the :ref:`figure-discover-screen-1`,
	choose **Automatically Detect**, and click
	**Continue**.

	.. _figure-discover-screen-1:
	.. figure:: ../images/ui/ui_screen_discover_1.jpg

		Discover Tab

#.	Click on :ref:`Enable <figure-discover-enable>` to
	enable the Automatic Discovery feature.

	.. _figure-discover-enable:
	.. figure:: ../images/ui/ui_screen_discover_2.jpg

		Discover Enable

#.	Click on the :ref:`Start <figure-discover-start>` button
	to start discovering hosts as they come on the network.

	.. _figure-discover-start:
	.. figure:: ../images/ui/ui_screen_discover_3.jpg

		Discover Start

#.	Power On the backend nodes one-by-one. They will PXE-boot,
	and will be discovered by the Cluster Manager node as shown
	on the :ref:`figure-discovery`.

	.. _figure-discovery:
	.. figure:: ../images/ui/ui_screen_discover_4.jpg

		Discovery Visualization Screen

	You should also see all the nodes start installation,
	and share packages. Once all the hosts have been discovered,
	click **Stop** to stop automatic discovery.

	.. warning::
		If automatic discovery isn't stopped, any new host
		that comes on the network will be discovered and
		re-installed, even if the host is not meant to be
		part of the cluster.

#.	Once all the nodes are discovered, and installed
	with the Operating System, they will reboot into
	the :ref:`figure-running`. The status lights to the left of
	the hosts will turn from :gray:`gray` to :green:`green`.

	.. _figure-running:
	.. figure:: ../images/ui/ui_screen_running.jpg 

		Running State

#.	After the status lights of all the nodes have turned to green,
	your cluster is now ready for use.
