Parameters

Examples
""""""""

``rocks sync host state compute-0-0``


	Sets compute-0-0 to the salt highstate.
	

``rocks sync host state compute-0-0 test=true``


	Dry run of highstate for compute-0-0.  This is usefull to inspect the
        currect state (and what is not in sync), and to see the full list of
        names and functions in the highstate.
	

``rocks sync host state compute-0-0 name=user-root function=user.present``


        Run the named state user-root function user.present on compute-0-0.  If the
        Attribute sync.root is defined as true this will set the root account password
        to the crypted valued stored in the attribute Kickstart_PrivateRootPassword.
