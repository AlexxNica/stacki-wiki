run host test
-------------

Usage
"""""

``rocks run host test [host]... [extras=string] [status=string] {test=string}``

Description
"""""""""""

	Run tests on hosts. This is commonly used to "validate" the
	hardware for a cluster.

	

Arguments
"""""""""
``[host]``

	Zero, one or more host names. If no host names are supplied, the command
	is run on all 'managed' hosts. By default, all compute nodes are
	'managed' nodes. To determine if a host is managed, execute:
	'rocks list host attr hostname | grep managed'. If you see output like:
	'compute-0-0: managed true', then the host is managed.
	


Parameters
""""""""""
``[extras=string]``

	Test-specific parameter.
	For the "all" test, this will be the filename prefix used to store
	the test results. All test results will append ".{test}" to the prefix,
	e.g., if "extras" is "/export/mytest", then the memory test results will
	be stored in the file "/export/mytest.memory". Default: "/tmp/test".
	For the "network" test, this is an optional parameter that can be
	used to specify which "network" to test. To get a list of networks,
	execute "rocks list network". Default: "private".
	
``[status=string]``

	Determine if "rocks run host test" is already running. If it is,
	output "is running". If there are no other instances of "rocks run
	host test" running, then output "is not running".
	
``{test=string}``

	The test(s) to run. Valid tests are: "memory", "disk", "network" and
	"all".
	If "all", then run "memory", "disk" and "network" tests on the hosts.
	

Examples
""""""""

``rocks run host test compute-0-0 test="memory"``


	Run the "memory" test on compute-0-0.
	

``rocks run host test compute test="all" extras="/tmp/test"``


	Run all the tests on all the compute nodes and store the results in
	"/tmp/test.memory", "/tmp/test.disk" and "/tmp/test.network".
