Examples

``rocks add host firewall localhost network=private service="all" protocol="all" action="ACCEPT" chain="FORWARD"``


	Accept all services and all protocols from the private network on
	the FORWARD chain.
	If 'eth0' is associated with the private network, then this will
	be translated as the following iptables rule:
	"-A FORWARD -i eth0 -j ACCEPT".
	

``rocks add host firewall localhost network=all service="40000"         protocol="tcp" action="REJECT" chain="INPUT"``


	Reject TCP packets that are destined for port 40000 on all networks
	on the INPUT chain.
	This will be translated into the following rule:
	"-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 40000 -j REJECT"
