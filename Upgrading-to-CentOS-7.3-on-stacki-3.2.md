<h2>Upgrading to CentOS 7.3 on Stacki-3.2</h2>

Are you sure you want to do this?

No. Are you really sure you want to do this?

Because stacki-4.0 is about a month away, and you don't have to do anything to get 7.3 on that. And it will be better.

No?

Okay. Fine. 

If Pontius Pilate<sup name="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> has any genetic material left 2000+ years later, I'm claiming it's in me. Because I'll give you the instructions on how to do this, but then I'm washing my hands of you.

To be fair, I'm currently doing this on every stacki-os-3.2 frontend I install to do testing. So, it works. I don't know if there are long-term consequences - you get to find that out. 

And I'll give you the gentle version first, which doesn't include your frontend.
