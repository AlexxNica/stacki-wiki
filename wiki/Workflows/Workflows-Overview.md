### Workflows Overview

One of the help requests we get frequently is for Workflows. Questions about how to get from point A to point B if I have C.

This is broken down into Basic Workflows and Advanced Workflows.

A basic workflow goes like this:

1. Install frontend.
2. Install backends.
3. Add a network.
4. Add a package.
5. Add a script.

Advanced work flows stem from the Basic Workflows. They start to address:

1. Multiple Networks
2. Multiple subnets responding the DHCP.
3. Adding an application.
4. Configuring an application.
5. Incorporating existing DevOps tools.
