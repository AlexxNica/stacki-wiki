### Things you can do but probably shouldn't..

We have a sayin' 'round these parts. (Well, I have a saying.)

"Stacki give you the gun, you have to find your foot."

There are some advanced techniques that we sometimes use and sometimes tell our users to use, because we want them to go away.

These are not guaranteed to work for you. You should have fairly deep experience with Stacki and want to do something the Stacki doesn't currently do natively.

You're forewarned and apparently armed, your foot is down. Help is in Stacki Slack or Googlegroups, but man, are we gonna laugh.
