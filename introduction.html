<h1>2. Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.stackiq.com/">StackIQ</a> software is used to provision and manage Linux systems.
From a single management host users can rapidly provision fully
configured Linux servers.
Once provisioned StackIQ provides a management portal for system
monitoring and management.
Central to the software is a database that stores the complete state
of your machines,
capturing what is truly unique to your infrastructure.
Additionally StackIQ provides turn-key solutions for Big Data,
Cloud, and High Performance Computing,
saving time and training to deploy complete systems in hours instead of weeks.</p>
<p>The software is based on the open-source <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rocksclusters.org/">Rocks</a> cluster
distribution <a class="footnote-reference" href="#rocks-license" id="id1">[1]</a>,
which is widely known in the HPC community for its easy
of use and flexibility.</p>
<div class="section" id="clusters">
<h2>Clusters<a class="headerlink" href="#clusters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>StackIQ views everything as a cluster.
Clusters have traditionally been thought of as homogeneous
servers - each configured identically.
However, even in High Performance Computing this has never been the common case.
Systems have always had heterogeneity at some level of hardware,
and multiple software roles for different sets of machine in the cluster.
StackIQ embraces this view while removing assumptions of any
homogeneity of both hardware and software for sets of Linux servers.</p>
<p>We define a cluster is a set of machines (typically called <em>Compute</em>
nodes) on the same network subnet all centrally managed by a single
StackIQ <em>Frontend</em> management host.
This is illustrated in the <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-cluster-architecture"><em>Simplified Cluster Architecture</em></a> figure.</p>
<div class="figure" id="figure-cluster-architecture">
<img alt="_images/cluster-architecture.png" src="_images/cluster-architecture.png" />
<p class="caption">Simplified Cluster Architecture</p>
</div>
<p>All servers managed by the <em>Frontend</em> must have a network interface
connected a single subnet.
This network is used for system provisioning, management,
and optionally applications themselves.
Servers can optionally include other networks which will also be
managed from StackIQ.
The <em>Frontend</em> must also have a network interface connected to this
subnet and may optionally have a secondary (or more) networks.</p>

<h2>Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="kickstart-installation">
<h3>Kickstart Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#kickstart-installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The StackIQ installer is built on top of Red Hat Anaconda and
dynamically creates Kickstart files to install machines from bare
metal.
Because we use a framework built on top of Kickstart,
StackIQ systems are managed at a much higher (and simpler) level
than systems using disk imaging or virtual machine images.
Seemingly complex actions such as swapping an OS between minor versions,
or updating a kernel become trivial operations.
Much of this is the consequence of managing a description of the
machine (Kickstart) rather than the image of a machine.
Think of this is the difference in maintaining the compiled object
code of a program versus maintaining the higher level program itself.
StackIQ is about programming your cluster, not managing at the bit level.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="avalanche-installer">
<h3>Avalanche Installer<a class="headerlink" href="#avalanche-installer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Avalanche installer is a peer-to-peer, package-sharing,
installation system. It was inspired by the BitTorrent file-sharing
system. It was developed at the Rocks Clusters Group
at UC San Diego, as part of the Rocks Clusters suite.</p>
<p>The Avalanche installer allows for package sharing between installing
hosts. The <em>Frontend</em> hosts all the packages that may be used to install
the <em>Backend</em> nodes. However, if all the <em>Backend</em> nodes are installed
at the same time, the <em>Frontend</em> may be overwhelmed by responding to
the number of packages requested. To alleviate this problem, the Avalanche
installer was developed.</p>
<p>The Avalanche installer allows each <em>Backend</em> host to download a small
subset of the overall packages, and then share these packages between
themselves during installation. This reduces the burden of package
distribution on the frontend.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stackiq-command-line">
<h3>StackIQ Command Line<a class="headerlink" href="#stackiq-command-line" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The StackIQ Cluster Manager suite has a command line utility
that allows the administrator to manage his cluster.</p>
<p>Managing a cluster is complicated business. Since a cluster
is a federated way of managing multiple hosts, disks,
networks, etc., administrators will need a consistent way to
manage these entities. Some of the requirements for managing
a cluster are -</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Maintaining the state of hosts</li>
<li>Maintaining the state of network configuration</li>
<li>maintaining the state of disk configuration</li>
<li>Ability to change the state of entities mentioned
above.</li>
<li>Ability to generate configuration files from the
maintained data about the cluster.</li>
<li>Ability to generate installation profiles for
hosts in the cluster.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In the initial days of development of the Rocks Cluster
suite, the above operations were performed using a variety
of simple scripts. These scripts, while functional, were an
administrative and developmental nightmare. Some of the
disadvantages of using these scripts were -</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Lack of consistency of usage,
parameters, and arguments</li>
<li>Lack of extensibility</li>
<li>Redundant Functionality</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The StackIQ Command Line, invoked using the command</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># rocks</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>was developed to address the requirements mentioned above,
and to alleviate some of the problems of using various scripts
for managing the cluster.</p>
<p>For more information about the StackIQ Command Line, see the
<a class="reference internal" href="rcl.html#rcl"><em>StackIQ Command Line</em></a> documentation.</p>

<div class="section" id="software-architecture">
<h3>Software Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#software-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All computer systems are inherently heterogeneous - both and the
hardware level, and at the software level.
StackIQ makes no assumptions of homogeneity of either of these layers (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#section-system-requirements"><em>System Requirements</em></a>).
Hardware differences are handled by the installer itself,
and software differences can be expressed in the StackIQ framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="appliances">
<h3>Appliances<a class="headerlink" href="#appliances" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We use the term <em>Appliance</em> to refer to a type of system with unique
functionality.
The default <em>Appliance</em> created by StackIQ is called a <em>Compute</em> appliance.
This name originates from High Performance Computing where the <em>Compute</em> nodes
are the fundamental element of the cluster.
The definition of a given <em>Appliance</em> is derived from the set of <em>Rolls</em> installed on the
<em>Frontend</em>.
For example, adding the Hortonworks <em>Roll</em> will extend the
definition of a <em>Compute</em> node to include Hadoop services.
Fine grain control over an <em>Appliance</em> is managed using <em>Attributes</em>,
which are simple key-value pairs applied to sets of hosts.
<em>Rolls</em> are also used to define the distributions used to install and update machine.</p>
<p>The combinations of <em>Appliances</em>, <em>Rolls</em>, <em>Attributes</em>, and
distributions are the key to defining and managing a StackIQ
system.</p>

<div class="section" id="system-requirements">
<span id="section-system-requirements"></span><h2>System Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#system-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>StackIQ supports all Red Hat Linux compatible operating systems,
which includes CentOS.
The current release of StackIQ is based on CentOS
6.6 and
works with previous 6.x versions.
StackIQ support all x86_64 systems,
with no support for other CPU architectures.
