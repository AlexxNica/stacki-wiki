<h5>The Guide to Installing Ubuntu with Stacki</h5>

In almost every meet-up and conference one of us has spoken at in the last 6 months, there is always at least one guy who asks "Can you install Ubuntu"? And the answer for the past 6 months has been "No, we don't." <sup name="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

Until today. 

\<Cue thunderous applause.\>

Okay, well mostly. I'm going to give you all the caveats first, and then if you really want to go down this road, it's less painful now because I walked it for you. (And, I might add, left it on the mat, put my heart an soul into, laughed, cried, bacame a part of me, spilt my life's blood, cursed the Gods on your behalf all while wondering why anyone thinks installing this OS is a good idea - for you, yes you.)

Installing Ubuntu, much like the installation of CoreOS, is a Phase 1 project. Meaning, that it's going to work, it will have some special sauce, but the two whole beef patties will be missing, which means it aint gonna be pretty. 



<h5>Future Directions</h5>

<sup name="f1">[1](#a1)</sup> One of you is going to say what about SUSE, and I'm going to say that I drive by the Novell building and there are tumbleweeds where a lawn used to be.
