### Create a new distribution

A new distribution combines a set of application and OS pallets to install backend machines. Allowing for different versions of OS and applications to be on different machines for either testing or production services. 

This example will create a new distribution using RHEL 6.6 instead of CentOS 6.5. We'll then assign a machine to the new distribution.
