If the "default" distribution meets your needs, use that. When your environment starts to become more complicated, distributions are one of the ways in which to handle the complexity. 

There are two ways to create ISOs to add to the frontend: download an already existing ISO or create a mirror using the "stack create mirror" command to download a repository and automatically create an ISO.

As an example, we'll download CentOS 6.6 and create a disribution. 

# Download CentOS 6.6

Either download CentOS 6.6 with wget onto your frontend or download CentOS 6.6 to a machine with network access and scp the ISO to the frontend.
